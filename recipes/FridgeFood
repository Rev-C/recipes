Fridge Food


I used to make this when tired and looking for something filling, it's entirely vegan (if you use vegan boullion), but you can add bacon or cheese on top if you want.

Essentials:
Oil (rapeseed, olive oil, sunflower, coconut if you want but I don't think it'd taste as good)
Onion
Potato
Tinned Tomatoes
Boullion

Optional: 

First Pot: 
Cabbage
Peas
Sweetcorn
Garlic
Mushroom
Spinach
Broccoli
(spices and herbs an additional optional)
Beans (not baked beans, unless you think the sauce will go well)

Second Pot:
Carrots
Sweet Potatoes
Celeriac 
Turnip
(anything really that can be boiled tastily) 

Instructions:

Chop all first-pot veg to sizes you enjoy eating. 
Heat deepish saucepan or pot
Chop onion into smallish pieces, doesn't matter whether cubed or slices.
Add oil to pan, then put in onions and stir a bit. After the onions are as soft as you like, add a teaspoon of boullion/one cube,
mix until covered and then add the rest of the first-pot veg. Stir for a bit, add more oil if needed, and then add the tinned tomatoes and if you've got beans (drain if you want), spices or herbs do that now too.
Then put on to simmer. 

Chop all the second pot items, put them in a pot and cover with water and put in a small pinch of salt. Put on to boil, then turn down to medium and cook until soft. 

If the first pot boils down a bit you can top it up with water or more tinned tomatoes if you want it super tomato.

Once they're ready (test by eating a bit of each pot and seeing if it's soft enough, also at this point if you want more salt in your tomato mix then do that)
drain the second pot, and mash it however you like your mash (a bit of oil is fine, as is no oil, or adding milk and butter is also nice)

Then put your mash in a bowl, and ladle on some of the tomato mix.

It's very filling and great for the winter, can cost very little to make and since it's basically just "What do I have in my fridge/freezer" you can add whatever veg you have.
